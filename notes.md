Honestly i've always been bad at documenting where I've gone/what I've done. I tend to only display the finished working products of things, and keep lots of prior information to myself.


Not really sure what else to put here, i had a fairly detailed journal this week instead. I'll work on improving documenting the process I go through instead of just end results.
