## Setting Up Github
Things went smoothly for me, I followed the walkthroughs and have consulted with some friends who use github frequently for some tips and tricks which should come in handy. 
I had one silly issue when trying to add my HelpRequestActivity file to my repository which I mention later that I was able to resolve.

## Setting Up Hypothesis
I was able to install and get set up on Hypothesis easily as the instructions were clear and the site made it easy. I really enjoyed using it with the readings as it allows for some dialogue with classmates about a reading but on our own schedule. I think this will be a really useful and fun tool to use.

## Setting Up Zotero
I had already installed Zotero and used it briefly for one essay after being recommended it by a friend last year. It is a really useful tool for keeping track of sources.

## Assigned Readings
### [Returning Women to the History of Digital History](http://www.6floors.org/bracket/2016/03/07/returning-women-to-the-history-of-digital-history/)
I found this article very informative as it really shone a light on how insular the digital history community can be, and that everyone is better off if everyone is included. I learned a lot about the various women and projects in the history of digital history which helps provide more perspective about how digital history was shaped and formed. 
I had some prior knowledge from taking the Introduction to Digital Humanities and Theories and Methods courses which touched a bit on Digital History but never delved too deep into it. I also learned more from the Book in the Digital Age course as well where we explored through readings and websites some of the early digital history works in preserving old texts.

I found it interesting how the movement to restore women's places in history is happening accross multiple genres. For example in fantasy literature scene, there is a lot of recommendations for great works that are all men, and lots of people often post lists of what they have read that year and are predominantly written by men. There are select few people, including one of my favourite authors Seth Dickinson, who make a point to tell people to read more books written by women, and that they have always been writing fantasy and scifi etc. but have been ignored. This movement is needed so that more people are able to see history for what it was, a collaborative effort to move forward.

## Help Request Activity
Today I performed the scenario where we have to submit a help ticket. 
I wanted to commit a file to my github, so I went into the command prompt and attempted to commit using git commit -m "this is a test", however I got the expected error about it not being a recognized command.

To learn more I googled the error came accross [this helpful article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4492979/git-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command) where I learned what was actually wrong with the attempt.
As I've learned from my limited coding experience from highschool, StackOverflow is a very helpful and useful website for dealing with coding and command errors.

While attempting to add my help request to my repository (late at night Saturday) I had the hardest time inserting the image into the file. 
I had no idea what was wrong with it since I was using the same notation as I had used earlier while playing around with Github and learning some basics. 
I watched Prof. Graham's video on how to insert an image and everything and even looked up additional guides that used html notation and tried that all to no avail.
So after 30-45 minutes of annoyed tinkering I shutdown my laptop and went to sleep. 
Then on Sunday morning when I went to have a physically distanced breakfast with family friends I realized the simple mistake I made. 
I forgot to add the .md to the end of the file name. Duh. Then when I got home I added the .md and tada it worked.
Glad I followed the 30 minutes guideline and shut down last night as I obviously wasn't thinking straight and just needed to look at it with a clear mind.

I was kind of unsure what we were supposed to be doing, so I just followed the guide exactly, and then after doing it I searched through the discord for "Demo Help Request" and found others who appeared to do something similar to me which validated my approach in my mind.
