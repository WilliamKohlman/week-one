Today I performed the scenario where we have to submit a help ticket. 
I wanted to commit a file to my github, so I went into the command prompt and attempted to commit using git commit -m "this is a test", however I got the expected error about it not being a recognized command.

To learn more I googled the error came accross [this helpful article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4492979/git-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command) where I learned what was actually wrong with the attempt.
As I've learned from my limited coding experience from highschool, StackOverflow is a very helpful and useful website for dealing with coding and command errors.


While attempting to add my help request to my repository (late at night Saturday) I had the hardest time inserting the image into the file. 
I had no idea what was wrong with it since I was using the same notation as I had used earlier while playing around with Github and learning some basics. 
I watched Prof. Graham's video and everything and even looked up additional guides that used html notation and tried that all to no avail.
So after 30-45 minutes of annoyed tinkering I shutdown my laptop and went to sleep. 
Then on Sunday morning when I went to have a physically distanced breakfast with family friends I realized the simple mistake I made. 
I forgot to add the .md to the end of the file name. Duh. Then when I got home I added the .md and tada it worked.
Glad I followed the 30 minutes guideline and shut down last night as I obviously wasn't thinking straight and just needed to look at it with a clear mind.
