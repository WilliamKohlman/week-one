## Setting Up Github
Things went smoothly for me, I followed the walkthroughs and have consulted with some friends who use github frequently for some tips and tricks which should come in handy. I also know some markdown already from utilizing reddit and having some coding knowledge.
I had one silly issue when trying to add my HelpRequestActivity file to my repository which I mention later that I was able to resolve.

## Setting Up Hypothesis
I was able to install and get set up on Hypothesis easily as the instructions were clear and the site made it easy. I really enjoyed using it with the readings as it allows for some dialogue with classmates about a reading but on our own schedule. I think this will be a really useful and fun tool to use.

## Setting Up Zotero
I had already installed Zotero and used it briefly for one essay after being recommended it by a friend last year. It is a really useful tool for keeping track of sources.

## Setting Up Discord
I was already a regular Discord user so when I heard that this class would be using discord for communication and to replace the classroom in a sense I was happy. So far I have enjoyed the interactions on the server, especially the cat discussions, and have found it useful for seeing how others have approached problems. It is also nice to have conversations with people outside of typical class hours, and it has been really nice to see clarifications from Professor Graham that have been helpful.

## Assigned Readings
### [Returning Women to the History of Digital History](http://www.6floors.org/bracket/2016/03/07/returning-women-to-the-history-of-digital-history/)
I found this article very informative as it really shone a light on how insular the digital history community can be, and that everyone is better off if everyone is included. I learned a lot about the various women and projects in the history of digital history which helps provide more perspective about how digital history was shaped and formed. 
I had some prior knowledge from taking the Introduction to Digital Humanities and Theories and Methods courses which touched a bit on Digital History but never delved too deep into it. I also learned more from the Book in the Digital Age course as well where we explored through readings and websites some of the early digital history works in preserving old texts.

I found it interesting how the movement to restore women's places in history is happening accross multiple genres. For example in fantasy literature scene, there is a lot of recommendations for great works that are all men, and lots of people often post lists of what they have read that year and are predominantly written by men. There are select few people, including one of my favourite authors Seth Dickinson, who make a point to tell people to read more books written by women, and that they have always been writing fantasy and scifi etc. but have been ignored. This movement is needed so that more people are able to see history for what it was, a collaborative effort to move forward.

I really enjoyed the use of Hypothesis with this article as it was interesting to engage with other students in this format. I think it works well to replace in class discussion of readings since we can all comment at our own pace. Additionally some of the links and other things shared were interesting and insightful.

### [HISTORY CAN BE OPEN SOURCE: DEMOCRATIC DREAMS AND THE RISE OF DIGITAL HISTORY](https://ahropenreview.com/HistoryCanBeOpenSource/manuscript/)
I had more trouble getting through this one, but it was really informative and interesting. I did not really consider what drove the initial push for digital history or that it would have been the democratization. Although refelcting on it, and what the prevailing ideals of the time were, it makes a lot of sense to me now. It has made me think more about how digital history, and digital humanities on the greater scale, are expanding and continuing to progress. I plan on rereading this article later on in this course to see how my views and what I gather from this article change.

### [Twitter Thread from Amalia Skarlatou Levi](https://twitter.com/amaliasl/status/1245544256212807680) 
I found this thread insightful as well, as something that I have been cautioned throughout my history degree so far is that when considering sources, to always be aware of the context of them, and what that implies. I enjoyed the thread as it provided me with various resources where they acknowledge their failings/shortcomings. I appreciate these ones since they force me to think about the issues presented in a different lens. Instead of trying to be the purely "canon" version of history, by acknowledging their shortcomings they prompt the reader to interact with it in a different context. I plan on revisiting some of the resources to gain a better understandig of how to be inclusive and provide context while doing digital history.

## Help Request Activity
Today I performed the scenario where we have to submit a help ticket. 
I wanted to commit a file to my github, so I went into the command prompt and attempted to commit using git commit -m "this is a test", however I got the expected error about it not being a recognized command.

To learn more I googled the error came accross [this helpful article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4492979/git-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command) where I learned what was actually wrong with the attempt.
As I've learned from my limited coding experience from highschool, StackOverflow is a very helpful and useful website for dealing with coding and command errors.

While attempting to add my help request to my repository (late at night Saturday) I had the hardest time inserting the image into the file. 
I had no idea what was wrong with it since I was using the same notation as I had used earlier while playing around with Github and learning some basics. 
I watched Prof. Graham's video on how to insert an image and everything and even looked up additional guides that used html notation and tried that all to no avail.
So after 30-45 minutes of annoyed tinkering I shutdown my laptop and went to sleep. 
Then on Sunday morning when I went to have a physically distanced breakfast with family friends I realized the simple mistake I made. 
I forgot to add the .md to the end of the file name. Duh. Then when I got home I added the .md and tada it worked.
Glad I followed the 30 minutes guideline and shut down last night as I obviously wasn't thinking straight and just needed to look at it with a clear mind.

I was kind of unsure what we were supposed to be doing, so I just followed the guide exactly, and then after doing it I searched through the discord for "Demo Help Request" and found others who appeared to do something similar to me which validated my approach in my mind.


## My idea of 'Digital History'
Prior to this course, I had a brief idea of what Digital History was. My ideas were shaped by some of the courses I took at Carleton so far, namely The Historians Craft and The Book in the Digital Age, as well as a few 2nd year digital humanities courses. In my mind before those classes Digital History was just the modern approach to teaching history, utilizing digital tools and modern technology. However after I had Professor Graham as a guest lecturer in Historians Craft, I started to realize that Digital History was more than just the use of modern technologies to showcase history.

Side note, I was looking back through my notes from that guest lecture and this was in my notes:

![](HistoriansCraftNote.png)

Anyways, to me Digital History is a way to both recreate historical text/documents/images/content, but it is also a way to level the playing field to correct previous ignored factors and blindspots. Some pieces of work that I have come accross that fit this definition are [The Atlantic Slave Trade in Two Minutes](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/the_history_of_american_slavery/2015/06/animated_interactive_of_the_history_of_the_atlantic_slave_trade.html), and [Invisible Australians](http://invisibleaustralians.org/). These two resources highlight things that were already known, but presents them in a modern sense to show the modern audience how history happened, and provides some insight into previously ignored actors of history.

This week the sources that we've read have more or less confirmed my notion as the first reading is all about restoring those ignored in the history of Digital History. 
Then the second reading goes into the purpose of Digital History, whether it is democratization or enabling the masses to participate. I have to spend more time with this to let it fully sink in and for me to let what it is saying take hold. 
The third reading lists quite a few DH resources that acknowledge where their content is missing context, missing content, and is not representative of the whole narrative. 

I've been excited by some of these projects listed in the readings and they make me happy to see that there are people who care about these things and are actively trying to make a difference and push the field forward. 

Going forward I'm not really sure where I see Digital History going. I guess I want to see it gain more mainstream appeal/utilization so that those kids that are not stimulated by reading a textbook are equally able to interact with history as the kids that absolutely love reading anything about the past. My hope is that everyone is able to find some form of history that interests them and is able to explore it fully.

## Overall Reflections
I was not able to set aside as much time as I wanted to this week for this course. I'm currently employed with the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada so I work 8-4 every week day and my plan was to dedicate a few hours each night to this class. However I also work part time at the local pizza place by my house and I had to fill in this week as teenage boys and their cars are not the most reliable beings. This cut the time i had available to either late at night while I was exhausted oron the few nights I had off. I also wanted to balance my social life a bit and still have some video game sessions with friends and kept in contact with other groups I have on discord. Despite these setbacks, I still feel like I engaged with the material to a satisfactory degree but would have liked more time to think about everything.
Additionally, I had some trouble with the asking for help portion, as I think I overthought things as it appears others on discord did. So I followed some of Prof. Graham's direction provided to other students and followed along with the instructions exactly as they were laid out I think.

Another thing is that I am not quite sure what the role of the journal and notes are. It seems like the notes are mainly to keep track of things that I've done specifically, such as commands and websites used while the journal is to reflect on things done and where we want to go from here. Who knows if this is the intended use.

I've never been great with seeking help, I often try and get everything done on my own first. However I also often seek out ways to help people in ways that I would not accept or enjoy myself. I have the same issue with essays a lot of the time, I like to edit and review my own essay, but I often do not solicit others opinions or help. However with friends I often offer my services to help them get their work where they want to be. 
During this course I am going to work on looking for, and accepting help on my own, while still being available to help others. At least that is my hope.


Who knows if I did any of this right ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
